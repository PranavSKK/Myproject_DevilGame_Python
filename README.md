# My_Project_TreasureHunter_Game_Python
In this Project,I have made a game in Python,where there are three character Man,Treasure,Devil
and space of blocks are designed in the game for positions of all three character and two stages are
set, the code is written is such a way that based on moment of man two types of result will be
displayed one is "Treasure is Hunted" means "won" and another one is "Devil has Eaten you" means
"lost"and program ends,for every position of "Man" four possible ways are given and only of that will
lead him to next stage,for taking repetitive steps "While loop" is used.
